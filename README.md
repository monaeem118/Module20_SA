# Individual Self-Assessment

I think this is one of my best achievements and by far the most rewarding experience in terms of learning, utilization of skillset and teamwork. The two main roles where I contributed were: 1) Leading and co-ordinating with the team and 2) Implementing the Machine Learning model.

From initiating the very first meeting in sketching out the plan for final project to preparing the final presentation, I think that not only I was able to discover my potential but also was able to identify the strengths of my team members as well. This helped me in successfuly co-ordinating with the team and  assigning them tasks based on their areas of strength. I managed to conduct our team meetings in timely manner and assigning action items to each team member as we moved along the project. This included peer reviews, code reviews and resolving conflicting situations.

My second important role was to devise and develop a machine learning model to successfully address the problem of diabetes patient hospital re-admission that we were trying to solve. This required many trials and errors, multiple iterations to tweak the model and was a great learning experience.

Though my main role was to develop a machine learning model but I have my finger prints in every section of the project as I wrote my own version of Exploratory Data Analysis and finally merged it with the one that our other team member performed. I also contributed on guiding our team member who was incharge of writing the database. Last but not the least I organized the final slides of the presentation and co-ordinated with the team to tie any loose ends.

# Team Assessment

Our main communication channel was slack. The main challenge was to work around every team member's schedule because 3 out of 4 members were working fulltime. Fortunately, We were able to resolve this by meeting in the evenings around 7pm and that worked for all of us. Second most important challenge was the selection of dataset or problem statement. The Exloratory Data Analysis requires a significant amount of time so one suggestion for a new cohort would be to keep that in mind and start exploring early enough to avoid any hiccups in the middle of the project.

# Summary of Project

The purpose of this project is to determine if a machine learning model could be created that would significantly predict early readmissions (defined as less than 30 days from discharge) of diabetic patients using demographic information, treatment, clinical and utilization data, icd-9 codes and hospital details using ML techniques. This project is based on a study that uses the Health Facts database (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO), a national data warehouse that collects comprehensive clinical records across hospitals throughout the United States.

We chose Random Forest Classifier to be our final model that could predict our target variable (i.e. Patient readmission in < 30 days) with an accuracy of 92%. As a result of our analysis we determined that the most important feature was found to be num_lab_procedures. One more important observation was that analysis was limited by the available data and excluded or missing/unobservable features may significantly contribute to the variance. For example, physician age and experience, or condition related re-admissions, etc. may contribute significantly.
